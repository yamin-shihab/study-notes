## Sentences

+ Another name for a compound sentence is a coordination sentence, and another name for a complex sentence is a subordination sentence.
+ Compound-complex sentences are also known as coordination-subordination sentences.
+ Appositive sentences add in additional information about the subject via what's called an apposition, often surrounded with commas. (Ketchup chips, the worst kind of chips, are somehow liked by many people.)

## Essay Writing

+ Essays do numerous things, including explaining, persuading, arguing, describing, and storytelling, but regardless of the purpose of an essay, it will always have a main idea and some supporting details.
+ In the introduction, an overview about the information the whole essay will include is provided.
    + The hook grabs the reader's attention right from the start. An essay should be engaging from the first sentence. (What's more dangerous: vending machines or sharks?)
        + A good hook can be interesting information, a question, general statement, quote, symbolic/metaphorical connection, or anecdote (brief story).
    + The bridge connects the hook to the thesis statement. If it weren't for a bridge, a hook would surround like an out-of-context sentence with no connection the main point. (Although it might seem like sharks kill more, vending machine statistics prove this wrong.)
    + The thesis statement is the most important sentence in the essay; it states the main idea and tells the reader what's going to be proved in the writing. (Vending machines are dangerous and more regulations should be put in place to keep everyone safe.)
    + The direction statement tells the reader what the three body paragraphs of the essay will be about and in what order they will be written. (I'm sort of stumped for this one; I don't want to write a direction statement about dangerous vending machines!)
+ The three body paragraphs of an essay contain the proof for the thesis statement and develop the main idea.
    + In each paragraph, there's a topic sentence, for they state the main idea of the paragraph. They must be connected to the thesis statement.
    + Each paragraph must have three supporting or key details. They must follow the following structure:
        + The focus of the key detail is stated.
        + Evidence will be provided in favor of the point.
        + This evidence will be explained.
        + All of this must relate to the topic sentence of the paragraph.
    + Transition words should be used to connect every point together. (first, furthermore, for example, similarly, however, finally)
    + In the conclusion sentence of a paragraph, the topic sentence is restated in different words. It also links the paragraph to the next one.
+ An essay finishes with a conclusion paragraph. It restates the main idea again, and it should end with an insight that shows a new or deeper understanding of the thesis statement.
