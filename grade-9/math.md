*I bet that like literally every previous year ever, Math will be about 90% repetitive.*

## The Number System

+ Complex numbers include pretty much everything. They include real and imaginary numbers.
    + Imaginary numbers involve the variable i (the square root of -1). You'll learn more about this later in life.
    + Real numbers have rational and irrational rational numbers. Any real number can be represented on the number line.
        + Irrational numbers are infinitely precise/repeating numbers with no identifiable pattern (can't be represented as a "normal" fraction).
        + Rational numbers can be written as the quotient of two integers. They consist of integers.
        + Integers are any non-decimal number, whether it's positive or negative.
        + Whole numbers are positive integers, including zero.
        + Natural numbers are whole numbers, without zero.
