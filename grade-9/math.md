# Math 9

*I bet that like literally every previous year ever, Math will be about 90% repetitive.*

## The Number System

+ Complex numbers include pretty much everything. They include real and imaginary numbers.
    + Imaginary numbers involve the variable i (the square root of -1). You'll learn more about this later in life.
    + Real numbers have rational and irrational rational numbers. Any real number can be represented on the number line.
        + Irrational numbers are infinitely precise/repeating numbers with no identifiable pattern (can't be represented as a "normal" fraction).
        + Rational numbers can be written as the quotient of two integers. They consist of integers.
        + Integers are any non-decimal number, whether it's positive or negative.
        + Whole numbers are positive integers, including zero.
        + Natural numbers are whole numbers, without zero.

## Powers and Exponents

+ The "standard form" of a power is pretty much just the answer.
+ To calculate the perfect square root of a fraction, find equivalent fractions until both the numerator and denominator are perfect squares. (sqrt(18/32) = sqrt(9/16) = 3/4)
+ To calculate the perfect square root of a decimal, put the number into a fraction where the denominator is a perfect square base ten number. (sqrt(2.25) = sqrt(225/100) = 15/10 = 3/2 = 1.5)
+ The square roots of whole numbers can be estimated by benchmarking them, or finding the previous and next perfect squares. (sqrt(45) -> between sqrt(36) and sqrt(49), but closer to the next -> about 6.7)
+ To estimate large numbers with lots of zeros at the end, pair each two zeros into one, and then use the square root of the first digit(s) to prefix the result. (sqrt(800,000,000) -> 2.8, 0, 0, 0, 0 -> about 28,000)
+ To estimate small decimal numbers with lots of zeros at the start, pair each two zeros past the point into one, and then use the square root of the last digit(s) to suffix the result. (sqrt(0.000008) -> 0, 0, 2.8 -> about 0.0028)
+ There are two types of negative powers, both of which comply with the standard order of operations:
    + In an expression like -3^4, the negative isn't included with the base, so the answer is -81 (-(3 * 3 * 3 * 3)).
    + In an expression like (-3)^4, the negative is included with the base, so the answer is 81 (-3 * -3 * -3 * -3).
+ A power with the exponent zero is equal to one and changes according to sign. This is caused by a pattern that can be observed by comparing the division of the result of each expression by the base while decrementing the exponent each time. (5^3 = 125 -> 125 -> 125 / 5 = 25 -> 5^2 = 25 -> 25 / 5 = 5 -> 5 / 5 = 1 -> 5^0 = 1)
+ There exist numerous exponent laws that make expressions easier to evaluate, and they predominately rely on the fact that the multiplication of numbers in any order doesn't change the answer.
    + When multiplying powers with the same base, the answer can be simplified by adding the exponents. (5^3 * 5^2 = 5^5)
    + When dividing powers with the same base, the answer can be simplified by subtracting the exponents. (5^6 / 5^2 = 5^4)
    + A power of a power can be simplified by multiplying the exponents. (5^2^4 = 5^8)
    + If two powers with different bases but the same exponent are being multiplied, the two bases can be multiplied and brought up to the power of the common exponent. (3^4 * 2^4 = 6^4)
    + If two powers with different bases but the same exponent are being divided, the two bases can be divided and brought up to the power of the common exponent. (18^3 / 9^3 = 2^3)
