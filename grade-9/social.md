## Federal Government Politics

+ The government is the body with power to make decisions for a society (governance).
+ Canada's constitution is the law that describes governance in the country. It sets out the roles of the three branches of government and how they work together. It also sets out other institutions like the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
+ The king or queen of Britain is represented in Canada by the governor general, who is part of both the executive and legislative branches of the government. The monarch is the formal head of state in Canada, but doesn't play an active role in Canada's government.
+ The executive branch proposes most laws, puts them into action, and runs the day-to-day business of the federal government. It includes the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.
    + The PM is the head of Canada's government. To be one, they have to be elected as the leader of a political party. Then, they must be elected as a member of parliament, and the party has to win the most seats in the House of Commons.
        + The PM decides what portfolios to include in the cabinet and chooses cabinet ministers.
    + The cabinet includes cabinet ministers with responsibility for different government departments and agencies or portfolios, such as health, finance, defense, trade, justice, and environment.
        + Cabinet ministers belong to the leading political party in the House of Commons and are members of parliament or senators. The cabinet also proposes most bills.
+ The legislative branch makes laws and represents the interests and rights of Canada's regions. It includes the House of Commons and the Senate and is also often known as Canada's parliament.
    + The House of Commons is the major law-making body in the country's federal political system; members debate study, debate, and vote on proposed laws, called bills.
        + Each MP represents the constituents (voters) of one riding/district, and because of representation by population, the higher the population in an area, the more seats available for its riding
            + The popular vote is the total number of votes cast in an election for each party, rather than the seats won for each party.
            + The first-past-the-post system is when the candidate with the most votes wins all.
        + If a party wins the majority of the seats in the House, it always forms the government. However, if a political party wins the most seats (not the majority), a minority government is formed where the party will have to negotiate the support of other parties.
            + As of 2023, there are 343 total House of Commons seats across Canada.
    + The Senate can propose laws (except for ones that create or spend taxes), but usually only considers bills passed first by the House (a "sober second thought", or careful reconsideration).
        + Its members are called senators, but they aren't elected; the PM appoints them. They can remain in office until the age of 75. They provide another round of study, debate, and voting on bills and have the power to reject bills, but this is seldom done.
        + Rather than rep-by-pop, senators are appointed based off of some set divisions/regions, to better represent the minorities of Canada, like Quebec's francophone population.
            + As of 2023, there are 105 total senate seats across Canada.
+ The judicial branch applies and interprets laws. It includes Canada's courts of law, with the Supreme Court being the highest one.
    + The Supreme Court has the final word on all legal questions in the country, including questions about the rules for making and applying laws.
        + For most of Canada's history, the PM and cabinet have appointed Supreme Court judges. However, former PM Stephen Harper later changed the appointment process, so that the executive branch nominates judges, who then go through a review by a committee of MPs.
    + It is separate form the other branches of government, as it acts as a check on their powers. It interprets and applies all law in Canada, to make sure the rights of Canadians are respected.
+ Civil service includes the people who serve Canadians as employees of the government.
+ For a bill to become a law, there's quite the process to go through:
    1. In the House of Commons, the fist reading is when the bill is proposed. There's no debate or vote.
    2. The second reading is when the bill is studied by MPs, and it can either be rejected or passed on. Debate and vote is made to find out whether the bill serves the interests of Canadians.
    3. In the committee stage, a committee of MPs/senators reviews the bill with the help of witnesses including experts and citizens. It issues a report with recommendations that the House or Senate usually accepts.
    4. During the report stage, debate and vote on the bill's amendments are made.
    5. In the third reading, the House debates and votes on the final form of the bill.
    6. The entire process above is repeated all over again, but by the senate.
    7. The House of Commons and Senate debate and vote on each other's amendments and decisions before coming to an agreement.
    8. The bill becomes a law after the Governor General gives Royal assent; this is a formality.
+ A lobbyist is someone hired by a group to influence MPs and government officials.
    + They have to register with a Commissioner of Lobbyists, so that everyone in Canada can know who they are and who they represent.
    + They voice their views of groups on issues that affect their members, products, or services. These issues can also affect everyone, so lobbyists provide different perspectives and in-depth expertise on many issues.
