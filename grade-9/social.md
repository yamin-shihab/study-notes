## Federal Government Politics

+ The government is the body with power to make decisions for a society (governance).
+ Canada's constitution is the law that describes governance in the country. It sets out the roles of the three branches of government and how they work together. It also sets out other institutions like the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
+ The king or queen of Britain is represented in Canada by the governor general, who is part of both the executive and legislative branches of the government. The monarch is the formal head of state in Canada, but doesn't play an active role in Canada's government.
+ The executive branch proposes most laws, puts them into action, and runs the day-to-day business of the federal government. It includes the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.
    + The PM is the head of Canada's government. To be one, they have to be elected as the leader of a political party. Then, they must be elected as a member of parliament, and the party has to win the most seats in the House of Commons.
        + The PM decides what portfolios to include in the cabinet and chooses cabinet ministers.
    + The cabinet includes cabinet ministers with responsibility for different government departments and agencies or portfolios, such as health, finance, defense, trade, justice, and environment.
        + Cabinet ministers belong to the leading political party in the House of Commons and are members of parliament or senators. The cabinet also proposes most bills.
+ The legislative branch makes laws and represents the interests and rights of Canada's regions. It includes the House of Commons and the Senate and is also often known as Canada's parliament.
    + The House of Commons is the major law-making body in the country's federal political system; members debate study, debate, and vote on proposed laws, called bills.
        + Each MP represents the constituents (voters) of one riding/district, and because of representation by population, the higher the population in an area, the more seats available for its riding
            + The popular vote is the total number of votes cast in an election for each party, rather than the seats won for each party.
            + The first-past-the-post system is when the candidate with the most votes wins all.
        + If a party wins the majority of the seats in the House, it always forms the government. However, if a political party wins the most seats (not the majority), a minority government is formed where the party will have to negotiate the support of other parties.
            + As of 2023, there are 343 total House of Commons seats across Canada.
    + The Senate can propose laws (except for ones that create or spend taxes), but usually only considers bills passed first by the House (a "sober second thought", or careful reconsideration).
        + Its members are called senators, but they aren't elected; the PM appoints them. They can remain in office until the age of 75. They provide another round of study, debate, and voting on bills and have the power to reject bills, but this is seldom done.
        + Rather than rep-by-pop, senators are appointed based off of some set divisions/regions, to better represent the minorities of Canada, like Quebec's francophone population.
            + As of 2023, there are 105 total senate seats across Canada.
+ The judicial branch applies and interprets laws. It includes Canada's courts of law, with the Supreme Court being the highest one.
    + The Supreme Court has the final word on all legal questions in the country, including questions about the rules for making and applying laws.
        + For most of Canada's history, the PM and cabinet have appointed Supreme Court judges. However, former PM Stephen Harper later changed the appointment process, so that the executive branch nominates judges, who then go through a review by a committee of MPs.
    + It is separate form the other branches of government, as it acts as a check on their powers. It interprets and applies all law in Canada, to make sure the rights of Canadians are respected.
+ Civil service includes the people who serve Canadians as employees of the government.
+ For a bill to become a law, there's quite the process to go through:
    1. In the House of Commons, the fist reading is when the bill is proposed. There's no debate or vote.
    2. The second reading is when the bill is studied by MPs, and it can either be rejected or passed on. Debate and vote is made to find out whether the bill serves the interests of Canadians.
    3. In the committee stage, a committee of MPs/senators reviews the bill with the help of witnesses including experts and citizens. It issues a report with recommendations that the House or Senate usually accepts.
    4. During the report stage, debate and vote on the bill's amendments are made.
    5. In the third reading, the House debates and votes on the final form of the bill.
    6. The entire process above is repeated all over again, but by the senate.
    7. The House of Commons and Senate debate and vote on each other's amendments and decisions before coming to an agreement.
    8. The bill becomes a law after the Governor General gives Royal assent; this is a formality.
+ A lobbyist is someone hired by a group to influence MPs and government officials.
    + They have to register with a Commissioner of Lobbyists, so that everyone in Canada can know who they are and who they represent.
    + They voice their views of groups on issues that affect their members, products, or services. These issues can also affect everyone, so lobbyists provide different perspectives and in-depth expertise on many issues.

## Youth Justice System

+ Justice is the application of laws, and justice systems are the institutions and procedures for doing that in a society. They should be fair and equitable (governed by rules that apply to everyone, taking into account individual needs and circumstances).
+ A sentence is a consequence for a crime, such as imprisonment, as determined by a court of law, and community service is help in the community performed as part of a sentence, such as assisting a community clean-up or food bank.
+ A criminal record is a permanent record of breaking the law, which is public information. It can bar people from some jobs, volunteer positions, and travel to other countries.
+ Rehabilitation is the act of instilling supposedly positive behaviours and attitudes, and reintegration is the act of making someone part of something else like society again.
+ Canada has different legislation for young people who break the law and for adults who break the law. The YCJA (Youth Criminal Justice Act) was passed by parliament in 2003. Laws like these, that treat young offenders differently from adult offenders, have existed since the 1890s in this country. This is done because youth are often not as developed or mature as adults.
    + The YCJA has quite a bit of differences with the way it deals with youth and adult offenders:
        + The YCJA deals with youth 12 to 17 years old in trouble with the law; it allows some young offenders to face consequences such as counselling and community services.
        + Adult sentences are prohibited for youth 12 to 14 years of age, but they're allowed for serious crimes committed by older young people.
        + Unlike adults, the names of young offenders can't be published by news media to protect their privacy, unless if an adult sentence is received.
        + The avoidance of a criminal record is allowed a lot of the time, while adults often have their criminal record modified.
    + The goal of the YCJA is to attempt to follow its intentions:
        + It attempts to prevent crime by addressing the circumstances underlying a young person's offending behaviour, so counselling may be needed for alcohol, drug, or family abuse, as an example.
        + It attempts to rehabilitate young persons who commit offences and reintegrate them into society, by for example finding them positive ways to participate in their community.
        + The YCJA tries to ensure that a young person is subject to meaningful consequences for their offence in order to promote the long-term protection of society (property being damaged may result in property being repaired).
+ In a court, the jury is a group of twelve people that must agree on a verdict; their decision has to be unanimous, or a consensus.
    + Any Canadian citizen of at least 18 years of age is eligible for jury duty, with some exceptions, like people convicted of crime.
    + Serving on juries is considered a duty of Canadian citizens. If one is to be summoned to jury duty, it's their responsibility to appear at the courthouse on time. Any arrangements must be made.
    + People may be excused from jury duty if they can demonstrate that it would cause them undue hardship.
+ Canada has two major citizen led organizations involved in the justice system: the John Howard Society for everyone, and the Elizabeth Fry Society for females.
    + These organizations work independently of government and try to solve the underlying reasons for crime. They also provide public education about laws and the justice system, including the YCJA.
    + They work with youths and adults who've broken the law to help them return to their communities. This including assistance with finding jobs and places to live. Meetings between the victims and offenders are also sometimes arranged.
    + They stand up for the rights of people accused of crimes, and call for measures to improve the fairness of the justice system for the accused and the victims.
+ In the societies of many aboriginal peoples, sentencing circles are similar to Youth Justice Committees in that they act on the idea that breaking a law harms everyone in a community. Elders, along with the rest of the community, often play an important role in finding solutions.
