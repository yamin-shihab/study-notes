## Biodiversity

+ Biological diversity refers to the number and variety of species and ecosystems on the Earth and the ecological processes that they're a part of.
    + The Pacific Yew was thought to be a "trash" tree (only good for burning), until it was discovered that a drug could be made from it to fight cancer (Taxol).
    + The main components of biodiversity include:
        + Ecosystem diversity is the variation and diversity in the amount of different species in an ecosystem.
        + Species diversity occurs within individual organisms of the same species.
        + Genetic diversity occurs within organisms at a cellular level; it describes the variety of genetic material in all living things.
+ Animals of the same species need to have similar genetic and physical characteristics and be able to reproduce, creating fertile offspring. (all humans are part of the same species)
    + The process of different types of organisms evolving from another species into their own species to adapt to their environment is called speciation. (cats evolve into different species of cats)
+ Individuals form populations, which form communities, which form ecosystems, which form biomes, which form biospheres.
+ Variations exist within the same species as well as between different species; they allow for ecosystems to remain healthy or to recover faster and are measured with the Diversity Index. There are two types of variations:
    + Continuous variations have a variety of different possibilities for the same trait. (height, weight, hair color, wingspan)
    + Discrete variations fall into specific categories. There is little to no "range". (detached earlobes, tongue curling, blood type)
+ Adaptations are traits that increase organisms' chances of survival in particular environments. There are two types of adaptations:
    + Structural adaptations have to do with the physical aspects of an organism.
    + Behavioral adaptations have to do with the actions of an organism.
+ A niche is the role an organism has within a particular ecosystem. It includes things like what it eats, what eats it, its habitat, nesting site, range, habits, and effect on populations and environment.
    + Animals living in extreme ecosystems, like in the very northern or southern parts of the world, have broad niches and are called generalists to accommodate to the extreme changes there.
    + Animals living in less extreme ecosystems, like near the equator, have narrow niches and are called specialists to accommodate to the stability.
+ Species are linked by what each species depend on to survive. (bats depend on bugs to eat during the night, bugs depend on marshy areas like swamps to reproduce)
+ When basic, needed resources (food, water, sunlight, habitat) aren't plentiful, different species compete for the resource, and it's often not fair, as different species have different variations that can provide a benefit (adaptations).
    + Some animals, like the warbler, practice resource partitioning on the same thing (like a tree) by only accessing resources from different, specific parts of it.
+ When two creatures live in direct contact, with one always benefiting, it's called symbiosis.
    + When one organism benefits while the other is unaffected, it's called commensalism. (the cattle egret follows cattle and eats the insects that are stirred up as the cattle feed)
    + Mutualism is when both organisms benefit. (the Egyption Plover eats parasites that attack crocodiles)
    + An organism hurting another for its benefit is parasitism. (tape worms live in the stomachs of mammals and can grow very long and old)
+ Interspecies competition happens when two or more species need the same resource. This type of relationship helps to limit the size of the populations of the competing species.
+ In asexual reproduction, only one parent is needed to reproduce.
    + Binary fission involves the duplication of a cell to create two. The genetic material in the original nucleus is duplicated. Only single-celled organisms reproduce in this way.
        + The newly created cell is called a daughter cell.
    + Some fungi like mushrooms can produce spores (little escape pods) that have all the genetic material needed to form another life form.
    + In vegetative growth, the meristem cells (at the edge of a growing plant that reproduces cells rapidly) can repair if damaged or grow into another plant upon falling off into fertile soil.
    + Budding is a form of asexual reproduction whereby daughter cells grow off of the parent cells then break off once mature enough.
    + In asexual reproduction, cell division leads to identical daughter cells. The new cell is genetically the same as the original. This means that organisms can't adapt to their environment.
+ In sexual reproduction, two parents are needed and each parent donates half of the required genetic material.
    + In bacterial conjugation, a connection is made between two bacterium and genetic material is transferred, but this isn't reproduction because the numbers aren't increased (this is a precursor to reproduction specifically for diversity).
    + Zoospores are spores that move using tail-like flagella.
    + Zygospores are spores that come from two parents. Once the zygospore finds an appropriate place, it will grow. (fungus, mold)
    + Some plants reproduce sexually:
        + Angiosperm plants produce flowers. The stamen is the male part, and the stigma is the female part. Pollen from the male part needs to make its way to the stigma, and many flowers require that the pollen comes from a different flower (cross-pollination).
        + Gymnosperm plants don't produce flowers but produce cones called conifers. Pollen from the male cone is transferred, usually by the wind, to the female cone which eventually drops seeds.
    + Animals combine their gametes (sperm and eggs) outside or inside the body, depending on the species.
        + When a sex cell (gamete) is created, it contains half of the genetic code of the parent cell. Two parent cells combine to give the correct amount of genetic information.
        + A zygote is formed when two gametes meet (when an egg is fertilized).
        + An embryo is in the stage of development where structures are being formed, after a zygote's cleavage (cell division).
+ Offspring inherit heritable traits/characteristics from both of their parents, but not all of them are apparent.
    + Dominant traits (represented with D) will show up when at least one of the parents carry them. (black hair, brown eyes)
    + Recessive traits (represented with r) will show up when both parents carry them. (blonde hair, blue eyes)
    + Some traits are entirely dependent on the environment; they're called nurture traits, rather than nature traits.
+ Genetic information can be changed by factors in the environment to: mutations can cause changes in the structures of organisms, due to mutagens. (X-rays, ultraviolet rays, cosmic rays, and some chemicals can cause things like cancer)
+ DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), located in every cell's nucleus, controls everything's genetic information, like the formation of cells, what products they release, everything they do, and DNA is passed on from one generation to another.
    + The structure of DNA is similar to a coiled ladder (a double helix), where each side of the ladder is made of alternating subunits called sugars and phosphates.
        + The rungs of the ladder are pairs of of nitrogen bases that come in four different forms: guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine (G forms chemical bonds with C, and A bonds to T).
    + The sequence of bases or letters in DNA forms a code. It acts like a blueprint that controls the production of proteins in a cell. A section of the DNA molecule that codes for a specific protein is called a gene.
+ Chromosomes are tightly coiled strands of DNA. Human somatic (body) cells generally contain 46 chromosomes, which are found in 23 pairs, with one copy of each chromosome coming from each parent. Other animals have different amounts of chromosomes.
    + In the process of mitosis, a somatic cell divides into two by copying all of its chromosomes before splitting up. The resulting diploid somatic cells each have 46 chromosomes, or 23 pairs.
    + In the process of meiosis, a somatic cell divides into two after copying and mixing all of its chromosomes, but then each resulting two somatic cells divide again into a haploid gamete cell containing only 23 chromosomes rather than the full 46.
    + There are two sex chromosomes: the large X chromosome and the smaller Y chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have have an X and a Y chromosome.
        + When females form eggs, each egg will get one of the X chromosomes. However when males form sperm, half of the sperm cells will get an X chromosome while the other half will get a Y chromosome. This makes the odds for the offspring's sex to be about 50/50 upon forming a zygote.
    + Aging is most likely to be the result of chromosomes wearing out over time after each replication.
+ Genetic engineering, a form of biotechnology, moves desirable genes from one organism to another for more desirable characteristics.
    + The human gene for insulin being moved into bacteria allows for the bacteria to produce human insulin as a waste product, and this can be done in large quantities too.
    + A transgenic organism is one in which human genes are added into its fertilized eggs.
    + The increasing demand for fish farming or aquaculture has resulted in scientists adding genes for disease resistance and growth to fish for more fish.
    + Genetically engineered plants have also been altered to be tolerant of herbicide, lowering costs and reducing the amount of weeds.
+ Artificial selection involves some different techniques or technologies.
    + Selective breeding is when specific plants or animals with favorable traits are bred with each other.
    + Cloning creates organisms from cells.
    + Artificial insemination involves the artificial joining of the male and female gametes.
    + Vitro fertilization has selected male and female gametes fertilize in a controlled setting.
    + Genetic engineering directly alters the DNA of an organism.
+ The theory of natural selection was initially proposed by Charles Darwin. The Galapagos finches provide the best example of this theory (the fittest or best-adapted organisms for a specific environment survive). The theory can be summed up in about four statements:
    1. All organisms produce more offspring than can possibly survive.
    2. There are incredible variations within each species.
    3. Some of these variations increase the chances of an organism surviving to reproduce.
    4. Over time, the variations that successfully pass on lead to changes in the genetic characteristics of a species.
+ In the last 600 million years of Earth's existence, there have been five major extinctions. They are caused by things such as volcanoes, earthquakes, floods, fires, competition, or disease.
    + The rate of extinction is thought to be one species per day over the age of life on the plant, but today the rate is at about 70!
    + Extirpation is when a species goes extinct within a particular area.
    + Overspecialization, another cause for extinction, is caused by a species catering too much to a specific environment.
    + Insects have the highest biodiversity of any type of animal (the number of species).
+ The human impact on the world's species and biodiversity is massive: everything from pollution to agriculture.
    + Mankind has has been the cause for the extinctions of many species of animals because of hunting, such as passenger pigeons.
+ However, there have been efforts to assist with the protection and preservation of the world's biodiversity:
    + A protected area, such as a national park or reserve, enforce additional rules.
    + Zoos originally began as private collections of exotic animals kept by the rich, but they then soon became primarily educational institutions and sanctuaries for the protection and preservation of endangered animals.
    + Seed banks are established to gather and store seeds from plants that are threatened with extinction. Some are run for selling plants, while others are were made for research purposes.
    + Global treaties have been drawn up to protect endangered plants and animals. Some laws make it illegal to buy or sell such animals (like rare birds, reptiles, amphibians, elephants, leopards, cheetahs, or rhinos), or their parts.
