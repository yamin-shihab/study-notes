## Exponents and Radicals

+ Cube roots are like square roots, but cubes are the products of three equal factors (the root is the value of any of the factors). The operation is represented by a square root symbol but with a small 3 at the top left.
    + You can determine the square or cube root of a perfect square or cube by using prime factorization; make a prime factor tree and divide the prime numbers at the end into either two or three groups, respectively, each with an equal number of each number. Then, multiply all the numbers in a group. (sqrt(729) -> (3, 3, 3) and (3, 3, 3) -> 27)
+ When dealing with negative exponents, continue the pattern of continually dividing the result of the power by the base. (5^2 = 25 -> 25 / 5 = 5 -> 5^1 = 5 -> 5 / 5 = 1 -> 5^0 = 1 -> 1 / 5 = 0.2 -> 5^(-1) = 0.2 -> 0.2 / 5 = 0.04 -> 5^(-2) = 0.04)
    + This can be simplified by dividing 1 by the result of the power but with the exponent made positive. (5^(-1) = 1 / 5^1 = 0.2 -> 5^(-2) = 1 / 5^2 = 0.04)
+ One way of understanding rational non-integer exponents is to consider 25^(1/2) = 5; it can be made into (25^(1/2))^2 = 5^2, which can then be made into 25^1 = 25 using exponent laws. In other words, normal exponent laws apply to rational exponents, and you'll see that on tests.
    + Fractional exponents can be written as radicals. Radicals have the square root symbol, but the number on the inside (the radicand) is the base of the power, and a number to the top left of the radical symbol (the index) is the denominator of the exponent. The radical will then be put into parentheses and raised to the numerator of the exponent.
        + A mixed radical has a radical multiplied by a rational number, while an entire radical is just a radical. A mixed radical can be converted to an entire radical by raising the rational number on the outside by an exponent equal to the radical's index, and then multiplying the radicand by the result. (5 * sqrt(11) = sqrt(5^2) * sqrt(11) = sqrt(5^2 * 11) = sqrt(25 * 11) = sqrt(275))
