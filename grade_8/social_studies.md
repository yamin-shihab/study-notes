# Social Studies 8

Seems to be more thinking than memorizing compared to grade 7 social studies.

## Chapter 1

* During the middle ages, much of European society was organized in a system called feudalism: a hierarchy in which different people ranked differently from each other based off of their importance.
  * People were born into their level, and were expected to stay at that level.
  * Nobles and knights swore oaths of allegiance (loyalty) to the king. In return, they got land.
  * Barons, bishops, and other members of the Church held lots of power and land, as religion was a very important part of people's lives.
  * Most people were peasants who lived in rural villages on a manor. They were assigned strips of land to plant and harvest.
  * They turned in a portion of what they produced in to the noble that owns the land. Peasants were also illiterate and uneducated.
  * Freemen were peasants who rented land from their lord or worked for pay. The rest were serfs who were not allowed to leave their manor without permission, and rarely went far.
* Most medieval towns were centers for farm communities. They usually grew close to castles, palaces, or large monasteries.
  * They were crowded, dirty, and rat-infested places, but offered freedom and opportunities to people. (do what one wanted to do, marry whoever, make money in whatever way)
  * According to the law, runaway serfs could gain freedom by staying in a town for a year and a day without being discovered.
  * Peasants might open workshops, learn trades, or work for wealthy merchants.
  * Production of goods and trade in the towns was organized by organizations called guilds. They controlled prices, set standards, and decided who would be admitted to the craft.
  * After years of working and training, people would take a test to become journeymen and be admitted to the guild. They might even be masters later on and open businesses.
* The Peasants' Revolts were a series of revolts that broke out from peasants who had to pay high taxes and rents during the Hundred Years' War.
  * Peasants banded together to kill nobles and burn their manors, but they were put down by the authorities.
* The Black Death resulted in the death of millions of Europeans between 1346 and 1350. Regular outbreaks of the plague continued for the next several hundred years.
  * There were also many manor labor shortages and feudal estates going bankrupt. Nobles eventually had to start renting or selling their land to serfs.
* As time went on, more people began to keep track of time with clocks and bells instead of the sun, dials, water clocks, and hourglasses.
* With the rise of towns, society became less rigid. By acquiring wealth and skills (mostly in cities and towns), urban people could move up from one social level to another.
  * The power and social position of wealthy merchants and the new middle class was based on money rather than land.
  * People became more focused on showing off their wealth through their clothing, homes, and food.
    * This led to the introduction of sumptuary laws: laws that controlled how people could show off their wealth.
* Religion was a very central part of people's lives daily lives. Life was also very difficult, so a hope for a better life after death was important to people.
  * The church at the time was very important and had different roles within it. People also had to pay a tithe: a tax towards the church.
  * Some people decided to devote their lives to God and become monks; they entered monasteries and spent their time studying religious texts, praying, and working. They also helped other people through food donations for the poor, caring for the sick, and teaching children.
    * Monasteries were centers of learning during the middle ages, and universities that grew around them taught grammar, geometry, astronomy, religion, law, medicine, and music.
  * The Black Death made some people question their faith; their attempts at pleasing God haven't worked and felt abandoned.
    * People also started to take a critical attitude towards the church because of this. It was a wealthy institution that owned a third of Europe's land, received large sums of money in tithes, and some members like the clergy got caught up in the enjoyment of luxury.
* With all these reformations going on, a period of great creativity in the arts and sciences called the Renaissance was about to begin, starting in Italy.
  * It's name is French and means a rebirth of classical knowledge and learning.

## Chapter 2

* Marco Polo and his family were known for travelling along the Silk Road. Marco also told stories of his journeys.
* The Silk Road was the major series of trading routes that connected civilizations from the Mediterranean in the West to the Pacific Ocean in the East. It was helpful for the trade of items, foods, and goods.
  * It was also important because it allowed for the sharing of ideas, knowledge, stories, and experiences. It had a huge impact on the Renaissance.
* The crusades were a series of holy wars fought between Christian and Muslim forces aiming to gain control of sacred religious sites in Palestine important in the three Abrahamic religions.
  * They were mainly initiated by the Church in response to Turks taking over the land.
  * The Muslims regained control of Jerusalem after it was captured with the help of the Sultan Saladin.
  * Since the Muslim world was more advanced than Europe, an unintended consequence of the wars was the introduction of new ideas such as medicine, astronomy, philosophy, mathematics, and ancient literature to Europeans.
  * Muslim scholars also accepted the contributions of Christian and Jewish scholars.
  * There was also increased trade, and Europeans were introduced to new goods.
* During the Renaissance, Italy was a collection of city-states. A city-state consists of a city that is politically independent, and the rural area around it is called the hinterland.
* Different features contributed greatly to the economic success of Italy:
  * Of all of Europe, Italy was the closest to the port cities of northern Africa and the eastern Mediterranean Sea (they had spices and luxury goods), so trade was made easier.
  * The climate of Italy was milder than the climate in the European countries north of the Alps. This meant that travel was not interrupted, and crops like olives and grapes could be grown.
  * While other countries where monarchies (ruled by a king or queen), Italy was a republic and had independent city-states.
  * Feudalism wasn't as prominent in Italy compared to the other countries at the time in Europe.
* Because all the city-states wanted to expand, there was rivalry. For example, Genoa and Venice competed for control of the sea routes in the Mediterranean.
  * Venice became the largest ship-building center in Europe.
* The Polo family was also a group of merchants that made money by purchasing goods and selling them for a higher price somewhere else.
* There was a revolt in Florence caused by the unemployment caused by the Black Death. Workers like the ciompi wanted to form guilds, but couldn't because of powerful guilds and the government denying their requests. It caused an uprising that was then defeated.
* Florence's economy became so powerful that its currency became the most important currency in Europe during the Renaissance, thanks to its banks and bankers.
  * Usury, the practice of charging interest when loaning money to someone, was considered a sin by the Church. However with the growth of international trade, the Church began to allow charging interest for loans that involved risk.
* Wealthy Europeans travelled around on business, and helped with spreading Italian values and ideas across Europe.
* The Medici family was the most famous and powerful family in Italy, and were an important part of Florence's cultural and political life for more than 300 years.
  * They made a fortune as wool and silk merchants and bankers. They also built alliances with other wealthy families.
  * They got power by gaining important positions in the Church and getting married into Europe's royal families.
  * By 1434, Cosimo de Medici was powerful enough to take control of Florence, so he bought people's support and exiled his enemies from the city.
  * He then attacked and allied with neighboring city-states
  * Despite being ruthless in political matters, he and the Medici family helped promising artists.
  * Cosimo's grand-son, Lorenzo the Magnificent, was a patron of art and literature. He sponsored Michelangelo, Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, and other famous artists and thinkers.
