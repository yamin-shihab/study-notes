# Social Studies 8

Seems to be more thinking than memorizing compared to grade 7 social studies.

## Chapter 1

* During the middle ages, much of European society was organized in a system called feudalism: a hierarchy in which different people ranked differently from each other based off of their importance.
  * People were born into their level, and were expected to stay at that level.
  * Nobles and knights swore oaths of allegiance (loyalty) to the king. In return, they got land.
  * Barons, bishops, and other members of the Church held lots of power and land, as religion was a very important part of people's lives.
  * Most people were peasants who lived in rural villages on a manor. They were assigned strips of land to plant and harvest.
  * They turned in a portion of what they produced in to the noble that owns the land. Peasants were also illiterate and uneducated.
  * Freemen were peasants who rented land from their lord or worked for pay. The rest were serfs who were not allowed to leave their manor without permission, and rarely went far.
* Most medieval towns were centers for farm communities. They usually grew close to castles, palaces, or large monasteries.
  * They were crowded, dirty, and rat-infested places, but offered freedom and opportunities to people. (do what one wanted to do, marry whoever, make money in whatever way)
  * According to the law, runaway serfs could gain freedom by staying in a town for a year and a day without being discovered.
  * Peasants might open workshops, learn trades, or work for wealthy merchants.
* The Peasants' Revolts were a series of revolts that broke out from peasants who had to pay high taxes and rents during the Hundred Years' War.
  * Peasants banded together to kill nobles and burn their manors, but they were put down by the authorities.
* The Black Death resulted in the death of millions of Europeans between 1346 and 1350. Regular outbreaks of the plague continued for the next several hundred years.
  * There were also many manor labor shortages and feudal estates going bankrupt. Nobles eventually had to start renting or selling their land to serfs.
* As time went on, more people began to keep track of time with clocks and bells instead of the sun, dials, water clocks, and hourglasses.
* With the rise of towns, society became less rigid. By acquiring wealth and skills (mostly in cities and towns), urban people could move up from one social level to another.
  * The power and social position of wealthy merchants and the new middle class was based on money rather than land.
  * People became more focused on showing off their wealth through their clothing, homes, and food.
    * This led to the introduction of sumptuary laws: laws that controlled how people could show off their wealth.
* Religion was a very central part of people's lives daily lives. Life was also very difficult, so a hope for a better life after death was important to people.
  * The church at the time was very important and had different roles within it. People also had to pay a tithe: a tax towards the church.
  * Some people decided to devote their lives to God and become monks; they entered monasteries and spent their time studying religious texts, praying, and working. They also helped other people through food donations for the poor, caring for the sick, and teaching children.
    * Monasteries were centers of learning during the middle ages, and universities that grew around them taught grammar, geometry, astronomy, religion, law, medicine, and music.
  * The Black Death made some people question their faith; their attempts at pleasing God haven't worked and felt abandoned.
    * People also started to take a critical attitude towards the church because of this. It was a wealthy institution that owned a third of Europe's land, received large sums of money in tithes, and some members like the clergy got caught up in the enjoyment of luxury.
* With all these reformations going on, a period of great creativity in the arts and sciences called the renaissance was about to begin, starting in Italy.
  * It's name is French and means a rebirth of classical knowledge and learning.
