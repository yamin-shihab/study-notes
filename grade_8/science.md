## Mix and Flow of Matter

* A fluid is a substance that has the ability to flow (liquid or gas). A non fluid can behave like one when melted or dissolved into a fluid. They take up all available space in their container. (water, honey, air)
* Solids have particles tightly packed together and only vibrating in place. (tape dispenser, stapler, box)
* Liquids have particles with enough energy to slide past each other (fluid), yet still vibrate close to others. (water, honey, syrup)
* Gasses have particles so far away from each other that they seem invisible due to the space between them. They move easily in all available directions. (oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen)
* The Particle Model of Matter (PMOM) is always followed by all particles:
1. All substances are made of tiny particles.
2. All particles in a pure substance are the same.
3. The particles have spaces between them.
4. Particles are always in motion. The speed of the particles increases as temperature increases.
5. Particles in a substance are attracted to each other. The strength of the attractive forces depends on the type of particle.
* Solids melt or fuse into liquids, and sublimate into gasses.
* Liquids freeze or solidify into solids, and vaporize into gasses.
* Gasses deposit into solids, and condensate into liquids.
* Evaporation is a slower form of vaporization that allows for a wider range of temperature.
* Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, and ice melts at 100 degrees Celsius.
* All matter can be classified as either a pure substance or mixture of substances.
* Pure substances contain only one type of atom (element substance) or molecule (compound substance).
* Mixtures have two or more solutions mixed together.
* A homogeneous mixture has solutions evenly distributed and seems like one substance.
* A heterogeneous mixture has solutions clearly separated.
* When a heterogeneous mixture looks homogeneous, but settles over time, then it is called suspension. (salad dressing, clay mixed in water)
* The different parts/layers of a heterogeneous mixture are called phases.
* Heterogeneous mixtures that don't settle are called colloids.
* Emulsions are colloids that require an emulsifying agent to stay combined. (mayonnaise)
* A heterogeneous mixture that is obviously visibly separated is called a mechanical mixture. (oil and water)
* A solute dissolves into a solvent to form a solution. (salt or sugar in water)
* There is usually more solvent than solute in a solution.
* Diffusion happens when a solute's particles are more attracted to the solvent's particles than itself, and particles always move.
* To be soluble means to be able to dissolve in a particular solvent.
* Water is known as the universal solvent because it can dissolve many materials.
* The rate at which something dissolves can be increased through agitation (stirring/shaking), as it allows for the particles to be in contact with each other.
* Solubility refers to the amount of solute that can be dissolved in a given solvent; this is usually measured in grams dissolved per 100 grams of water.
* A saturated solution is a solution that can't have anymore solute dissolved in it.
* An unsaturated solution is one that could have more solute dissolved.
* Supersaturated solutions are solutions saturated past the limit. This is done through the use of cooling and crystals.
* When something is insoluble, it isn't able to be dissolved in a specific solvent.
* WHMIS (Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System) safety symbols are used to convey the possible dangers associated with a product. (bleach, ammonia, strong acids)
* Sometimes fluids are used to help solids flow by mixing or dissolving them together, but the solid must then be retrieved later on.
* A method of separating some solid from a fluid could be dehydration, which is usually done via evaporation. (desalinating water, dehydrated foods)
* The act of taking the fluid from the mixture is called distillation. (getting pure water from saltwater)
* This can also be done for solids. (ore extraction)
* Viscosity refers to the thickness or thinness of a fluid: the more viscous something is, the slower it flows. (syrup is viscous; water is less viscous)
* A liquid's flow rate is how fast a fluid "runs", or it's resistance to flow. (juice flows faster than honey)
* Viscosity is important in many industries like paint, beauty, and food. (lipstick, nail polish, paint, mascara, dressing, and syrup)
* The reason different fluids have different viscosities is because of internal friction (friction between particles inside the fluid itself).
* Temperature affects rate of flow because temperature is how active (moving) particles are. (hot is fast, cold is slow)
* The viscosity of a gas acts in the opposite way; the hotter gas is, the more it collides with each other, and the slower it flows.
* Density is how "crowded" particles are in a solid, liquid, or gas.
* Solids are generally denser than liquids, which are generally denser than gasses.
* The particle model of matter can tell us that the higher the density of something is, the smaller the space it takes up. (water compared to vapor)
* Mass is the amount of matter in a substance (grams), weight is the force of gravity exerted on an object (newtons (named after a smart guy (yay (nested parentheses)))), and volume is the amount of space occupied by something (liters or meters cubed).
* On Earth, the force of gravity pulls down an object with 10 newtons for every kilogram. (10 KG is 100 N on Earth)
* Density can be calculated by looking at the mass-to-volume ratio of things (D = M/V). (the higher the mass or lower the volume, the higher the density)
* Buoyancy is the tendency for materials to rise or float in a fluid, while buoyant force is the upward force exerted on objects submerged in fluids.
* An object is floating when it's neither sinking or floating and is in the same position.
* Average density is the total mass of an object divided by the total volume. To be buoyant, the average density of the object must be lower than that of the fluid.
* Most fish have what's called a swim bladder. The amount of air in it changes to change the average density of the fish and its depth underwater.
* Airships and hot air balloons float in the air because their average density is less than that of the surrounding air (hot air and helium is lighter than normal air).
* The Greek scientist Archimedes made a discovery after being tasked by the ruler of Syracuse to find out if a crown he has is made of pure gold. He famously made the discovery after seeing water spill while in a public bath.
* The Archimedes' principle states that the buoyant force exerted upon an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced when the object is submerged.
* A hydrometer measures liquid density by extending in different ways depending on how dense the liquid is.
* Pressure is a specific amount of force covered over a specific area. It is measured in pascals (named after a smart guy).
* One pascal is equal to one newton per square meter, so therefore pressure can be calculated with the formula P = F/A.
* Gasses are said to be compressible, because their particles can be pushed somewhat closer together while remaining a gas.
* Solids and liquids are said to be incompressible, because their particles can't be pushed closer together while remaining a solid or liquid.
* Compression is commonly used in some areas due to its useful property of being able to exert a force back. (car air bags, some running shoes, tires, grass in a field)
* The Earth's atmosphere exerts pressure too; it's just that we're really used to it. That's why if you guy really high up in a mountain or plane, you feel more sensitive to pressure change.
* Pressure is commonly measured with a barometer, and they used to be made of mercury. A barometer uses gravity's pressure over an area to push some mercury up a tube.
* When air pressure is unequal inside and outside an enclosed space, the walls of that space may cave in or expand to compensate. (sucking on an empty juice box)
* Particles flow from areas of high pressure to low pressure. (aerosol sprays)
* Hydraulics is the study of pressure in liquids, and devices that utilize liquids to move something else using pressure are called hydraulic systems. They commonly use a series of tubes, hoses and pipes. (faucets, bike/car brakes, dentist equipment)
* Pneumatic systems are similar, but use gasses instead of liquids. They use gasses instead mostly because gasses are compressible, so they require compressors (devices that... compress air).

## Cells and Systems

* Living organisms have signs of life: the requirement of energy, stimuli, reproduction, growth, and waste production.
* There are different levels of the organization of life. From smallest to biggest:
1. Cells: all life is made of this.
2. Tissue: different types make up different organs.
3. Organs: serve different purposes
4. Organ systems: multiple organs that perform a related task together.
5. Organisms: multiple organ systems working in conjunction.
* Microscopes are required to observe things too small for the naked eye to see.
* The Dutch merchant Anton van Leeuwenhoek and the English scientist Robert Hooke both experimented with early models of the microscope that used lenses.
* Leeuwenhoek called cells animalcules, while Hooke called them cellulae (small rooms in Latin).
* German botanist Matthias Schleiden, zoologist Theodore Schwa nu, and German scientist Rudolf Virchow said that all living things are made of one or more cells, and cells are the basic units of structure and function in all organisms.
* Today, microscopes have improved significantly. Electron microscopes bounce electrons off of surfaces to magnify images much more than light microscopes (2,000,000 times more for example).
* Compound light microscopes use multiple lenses to magnify much more. They consist of a tube, a stage, an arm, a diaphragm, a light source, a coarse-adjustment knob, a fine-adjustment knob, a revolving nosepiece, an eyepiece (or ocular lens), a condenser lens, and objective lenses.
* The magnification of a microscope is controlled by the selected objective lens. The total magnification is measured by multiplying all the lenses magnifications.
* The field of view of a microscope is how wide the view is. (smaller FOV means higher magnification)
* Unicellular organisms are made up of one cell, while multicellular organisms are made of many.
* Cells are made up of different organelles, which are like organs, but small enough for cells.
* The cell membrane surrounds and protects the contents of the cell and controls what goes in and out.
* The cytoplasm is like a jelly that holds all the organelles inside the cell.
* The nucleus controls the activities of the cell. It also contains the genetic material of the cell.
* The vacuole is a space for extra food, waste, and other substances that can't be immediately used.
* The cell wall surrounds the cell membrane and protects the cell with its tough, rigid surface.
* The chloroplast is where the process of photosynthesis occurs. Energy from the sun is used to create carbohydrates.
* The mitochondrion produces energy for the cell using tiny food particles.
* The ribosome make proteins.
* The rough endoplasmic reticulum serves as a base for ribosomes.
* The smooth endoplasmic reticulum produces fats.
* The Golgi apparatus processes proteins.
* There are two types of cells: animal cells and plant cells. They both have different organelles.
* Animal cells have all the organelles except for the chloroplast and cell wall, and they have multiple small vacuoles.
* Plant cells have all the organelles, and they have one big vacuole.
* Cells are very small[citation needed]; they usually have a diameter that measures from ten to fifty micrometers.
* If something is permeable, it allows particles through. (a shirt is permeable to water)
* If something is semi-permeable (or selectively permeable), it allows some particles through. (a cell membrane)
* If something is impermeable, it allows no particles through. (plastic is impermeable to water)
* Diffusion is when solute spreads from high to low concentrations in a solvent, until equilibrium is reached. (a fart spreading throughout a class)
* Osmosis is diffusion but across a membrane. This time, the amount of solvent that moved to the other side is measured. (plant roots absorbing water)
* These two processes are done in cells with foreign particles outside of it.
* A hypertonic solution has a greater amount of solute than another solvent.
* A hypotonic solution has a lesser amount of solute than another solvent.
* An isotonic solution has an equal amount of solute than another solvent.
* Plants have two vascular tissues to connect the roots and leaves. These are needed for creating sugars from water through photosynthesis.
* The xylem brings water and nutrients from the roots to the leaves.
* The phloem brings sugars (food) to the rest of the plant
* The roots of a plant are covered in small, thin hairs called root hairs. They increase the surface area of the roots to allow for more water and nutrient absorption.
* There are also stomata on the undersides of leaves. They allow for air to enter the leaves, and allow for water to leave the plant through transpiration.
* ~~Trans-pirate~~ Transpiration is the loss of water in a plant through evaporation.
* All cells are specialized and have their own purpose and task to do. This also results in different shapes. (heart cell, nerve cell, blood cell, skin cell)
* Multicellular organisms have several advantages over unicellular organisms: they can grow larger, live in a variety of environments, obtain energy from a variety of sources, and have cell organization.
* Tissues are groups of similar cells to serve a special purpose. (muscle tissue, nerve tissue, epithelial (skin) tissue, connective (bone) tissue)
* Organs are distinct structures of the body that perform particular functions. They are made of several types of tissues working together. (eyes, brain, stomach, heart, lungs, intestines, skin)
* Organ systems are groups of organs that perform activities to help the organism as a whole. (plants root system, plant shoot system, human digestive system, human circulatory system)
* The human body has three types of blood vessels, from first to last:
1. Arteries leave the heart and carry blood with them. They have thick, muscular walls
2. Capillaries allow for the exchange of oxygen with blood. They are very thin (about a cell thick).
3. Veins carry blood back to the heart and have valves to prevent backflow. They have thin walls.
* There are also different parts of blood: plasma is the liquid part, red blood cells carry oxygen, white blood cells defend against diseases, and platelets help stop bleeding.
* The circulatory system consists of the heart (which consists of four "chambers") and all the blood vessels associated with it.
* Here's the process of some air going through the human respiratory system, in order:
1. The diaphragm moves the lungs to inhale.
2. The air comes in through the nose or mouth.
3. It goes down the trachea and enters the lungs.
4. It then divides into the left and right bronchi.
5. Each bronchus then splits into thousands of bronchioles.
6. These in turn separate into millions of air sacs called alveoli.
7. The capillaries inside the alveoli take the oxygen from the air and infuse it with the body's blood.
8. The diaphragm moves the lungs to exhale.
* Here's the process of some food going through the human digestive system, in order:
1. The food enters through the mouth and gets chewed on to increase surface area.
2. Saliva assists with a form of chemical digestion.
3. The food goes down the esophagus through the process of peristalsis (contracting muscles).
4. The food enters the stomach and is digested through chemical (acid) and mechanical (churning) digestion.
5. In the small intestine, the nutrients of the food are absorbed. The small intestine is also lined with villi.
6. There are many villi to increase surface area, and they contain a network of capillaries for bringing food particles/nutrients into the bloodstream.
7. The large intestine's purpose is to re-absorb the food's water and move waste out of the system.
8. The food comes out of the system as ~~poop~~ feces.
* The nervous system consists of the brain, spinal cord, and branches of nerves and neurons covering the whole body.
* The excretory system eliminates waste products from the blood using the kidney by producing ~~pee~~ urine.
* The liver regulates many chemical levels in the blood and excretes a product called bile that carries away waste.
* The gallbladder holds bile before it's released into the small intestine.
* The pancreas contains glands that create substances that help with digestion and control blood sugar (insulin).
* Circulatory system disorders are the leading cause of death, and one of the most common is high blood pressure (hypertension). It can lead to heart attacks and strokes.
* Smoking causes many problems: nicotine constricts blood vessels, and carbon monoxide competes with oxygen in the lungs.
* High salt diets can raise blood pressure, straining the heart, and high fat diets clog arteries with cholesterol, leading to blood clots.
* Fat is different from carbohydrates in that it can be stored, but excess fat is bad.
* Proteins are essential for the growth and repair of body tissues.
* A low amount of fiber makes the colon spend more time processing waste materials; this can irritate the colon wall and cause colon cancer.
* Peptic ulcers are caused by long-term emotional stress, smoking, alcohol, and excess aspirin. They occur when a wall of the stomach or small intestine is damaged by extra stomach acid.
* The cilia in the respiratory system are hairlike projections that remove airborne particles. Smoke and pollutants irritate this lining, causing mucus. The lining will then be inflamed. This is called bronchitis.
* Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer: it starts when certain compounds contact lung tissue, and cells grow out of control and kill healthy cells.
