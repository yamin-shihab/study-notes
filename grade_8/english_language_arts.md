# English Language Arts 8

Good thing I learned a lesson from last year to start study guides early. Note from future (second last week of school): nope, you didn't learn a single lesson you idiot.

# ***!! ADDITIONAL NOTICE !!***

### For some reason, we learned almost exactly the same things this year and last year for English, so use the grade 7 study guide for English along with the extra things in this grade 8 English study guide.
