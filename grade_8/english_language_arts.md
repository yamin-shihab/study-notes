# English Language Arts 8

Good thing I learned a lesson from last year to start study guides early. Note from future (second last week of school): nope, you didn't learn a single lesson you idiot.

# ***!!! ADDITIONAL NOTICE !!!***

### For some reason, we learned almost exactly the same things this year and last year for English, so use the grade 7 study guide for English along with the extra things in this grade 8 English study guide.

## Sentences

* An independent clause consists of a subject (mostly a noun) and a predicate (mostly a verb). (Alice scorned Bob, subject: Alice, predicate: scorned bob)
* A dependent clause, or subordinate clause, consists of a subject and predicate, but can't function on its own. (Since the boys burnt the school down)
* A fragment is a group of words that lack either a subject, predicate, or both (slammed the door and left).
* A compound-complex sentence includes both a compound and complex sentence in one. (Because of the constant segmentation faults, he decided that it was time, and he took his life.)

## Grammar

* Commas have many uses:
  * They can separate several adjectives. (The old, dusty book lied on the top of the shelf.)
  * They can separate items in a list. (Among the list were many items: fruits, vegetables, bread, milk, and meat.)
    * The use of a comma before the last item is called the Oxford Comma and serves to prevent ambiguity.
  * To separate independent clauses in a compound sentence, commas are used with coordinating conjunctions. (She walked up the stairs, and he walked down the stairs.)
    * A lack of a coordinating conjunction (just a comma) is called a comma splice and is a mistake. (Eat it, go upstairs.)
  * Commas are used to separate introductory elements in a sentence. (Although it was almost 30 degrees Celsius outside, he was still wearing his winter coat.)
  * They can be used to enclose an aside. (The boy, who disliked the existence of nonsensical and inconsistent grammar, proceeded to study for his English finals test.)
  * Commas can be used to separate direct speech or quotations. ("Don't be stupid", he said.)
  * They can be used to separate elements of contrast. (It downloaded the virus, not the actual program.)
* The semicolon can be used in two ways:
  * In a list with where each element contains internal punctuation, the semicolon can be used in place of the comma. (The winners of the contest came from all over the country: Jeff, from Vancouver, Marcus, from Saskatoon; and Daniel, from Edmonton.)
  * Instead of using a period or coordinating conjunction to separate two independent clauses, one can use a semicolon to do so. The word that follows shouldn't be capitalized unless if it's a proper noun. (He keeps spending all of everyday staring at that monitor; he's addicted.)
* Colons are useful in mainly three ways:
  * A list can be introduced with one. (The following people should report to the principal's office: Danny, John, Suzy, and Rob.)
  * An explanation can be linked to a main clause. (The message was clear: kill, or be killed.)
  * Colons can introduce a quotation. (The headline read: "New SSH Vulnerability Discovered!")
* Hyphens, not dashes, also have three purposes:
  * They can form compound words. (The sugar-free cookie tasted good.)
  * Hyphens can be used to join prefixes to words. (The pre-algebra test was very annoying.)
  * Word breaks can be represented by inserting a hyphen at the part where a word abruptly ends before continuing on the next line. This is, however, becoming less common with the advent of computers being more commonly used.
* There are two types of dashes (note that I will be using a plain hyphen instead to support ASCII):
  * Em dashes have the width of the letter m and have some uses:
    * They can include parenthetical elements. (All the animals - the elephants, giraffes, gorillas, and lions - escaped from the zoo.)
    * An abrupt change of thought in dialogue can be represented with an em dash. ("I have something really important to tell - Oh wait... wrong number.")
    * Em dashes can add extra information after a list. ("Peanuts and gluten - she is allergic to them.")
  * En dashes have the width of the letter n and are used to represent spans of numbers. (The 2013-2014 season was horrible for the team.)

## Paragraphs

* There are several ways to arrange ideas in a paragraph:
  * Ideas are presented in chronological order (the same order that they occurred in time).
  * Ideas can be described in the order of some kind of space. (left to right, top to bottom, outside to inside)
  * Ordering by importance could mean starting with the least or most important idea and ending with the least or most important idea.
  * When a paragraph's ideas are ordered by climax, the writer can build suspense up to it.

## Nonfiction

* Nonfiction writing, as opposed to fiction, is about real things: people, events, things, places, etc.
* Common forms of nonfiction include:
  * Letters and journals contain personal thoughts and reflections.
  * Biographies are about the life story of someone other than the author.
    * Autobiographies are biographies, but they're are about the author.
  * Memoirs are about the author's records or experiences from their life.
  * Media accounts are works written for newspapers, magazines, television, or radio.
  * Essays are a discussion of a topic, express the author's feelings, and can tell a lot.
  * Articles are small in length and focus on the facts of the subject. They also express the author's bias.
* Nonfiction also has some common features:
  * Titles identify the topic of the text and what it's going to be about.
  * A table of contents tells the names of the chapter sand what page the chapters can be found.
  * An index tells what pages the reader can find certain topics.
  * Glossaries tell the definitions of some words found in the text.
  * A heading divides text into sections and explains what the sections will be about.
  * A photograph shows what something looks like (camera).
  * An illustration shows what something looks like (drawing).
  * A caption explains what a photograph or illustration is about.
  * Labels tell the names of certain parts of a photograph or illustration.
  * A graph organizes and helps compare information in a visual way.
  * Tables organize facts and numbers in a visual way so that it's easier to read.
  * Maps show where places are located and where events took place.
  * A diagram explains information or how something works in a visual way.
  * Bolded or italicized words put extra emphasis.
  * Bullet points make lists easier to read and understand.
  * Sidebars give extra information about a topic.
