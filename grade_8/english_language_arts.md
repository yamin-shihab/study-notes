# English Language Arts 8

Good thing I learned a lesson from last year to start study guides early. Note from future (second last week of school): nope, you didn't learn a single lesson you idiot.

# ***!! ADDITIONAL NOTICE !!***

### For some reason, we learned almost exactly the same things this year and last year for English, so use the grade 7 study guide for English along with the extra things in this grade 8 English study guide.

## Sentences

* An independent clause consists of a subject (mostly a noun) and a predicate (mostly a verb). (Alice scorned Bob, subject: Alice, predicate: scorned bob)
* A dependent clause, or subordinate clause, consists of a subject and predicate, but can't function on its own. (Since the boys burnt the school down)
* A fragment is a group of words that lack either a subject, predicate, or both (slammed the door and left).
* A compound-complex sentence includes both a compound and complex sentence in one. (Because of the constant segmentation faults, he decided that it was time, and he took his life.)
