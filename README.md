# study-guides

My grade 7 and grade 8 Alberta curriculum finals study guides for 2021-2023 so far. Feel free to share this around (other classes, grades, schools, can this even get outside of Alberta?)

## To-do

Note that as I'm still in school, more information about the units would be "unveiled". So when a unit is considered finished, I finished adding all the information there is available. Updates will still be added.

+ [x] [English Language Arts 7](grade-7/english.md)
+ [x] [Math 7](grade-7/math.md)
+ [x] [Science 7](grade-7/science.md)
+ [x] [Social Studies 7](grade-7/social.md)
+ [x] [English Language As 8](grade-8/english.md)
+ [x] [Math 8](grade-8/math.md)
+ [ ] [Science 8](grade-8/science.md)
+ [x] [Social Studies 8](grade-8/social.md)

## Contributing:

+ Learn how to make a pull request on GitHub.
+ Learn Markdown syntax; [this is a good resource](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/) (looking up other guides on the internet would also be a good idea).
+ Header 1 at top of every file (stating subject).
+ Each unit is a header 2 after that.
+ Sections are separated by a newline.
+ Parts of a unit are part of an unordered (and occasionally numbered) list.
    + You can use nested lists by indenting by four spaces.
+ Use + instead of -, or * for unordered lists.
+ Don't make parts too long.
+ Use correct spelling, and grammar.
+ I like the Oxford Comma and contractions.
+ Separate every three digits of a number with a comma (not a space).
+ Betray your country and use American English spelling instead of British or Canadian English spelling.
+ I prefer to use ASCII characters for compatibility.
+ Please stay consistent.
+ If you only want to point something simple out, submit an issue (not a pull request).
