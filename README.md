# study-guides

My grade 7 and grade 8 Alberta curriculum finals study guides for 2022. Feel free to share this around (other classes, grades, schools, can this even get outside of Alberta?)

## Contributing:

+ Learn how to make a pull request on GitHub.
+ Learn Markdown syntax: [this is a good resource](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/).
+ Header 1 at top of every file (stating subject).
+ Each unit is a header 2 after that.
+ Sections are separated by a newline.
+ Parts of a unit are part of an unordered list.
+ Use * instead of -, or + for unordered lists.
+ Don't make parts too long.
+ Use correct spelling, and grammar.
+ I like the Oxford Comma.
+ I like contractions.
+ Separate every three digits of a number with a space (not a comma).
+ I prefer to use ASCII characters for compatibility.
+ Please stay consistent.
+ If you only want to point something simple out, submit an issue (not a pull request).

## To-do

Note that as I'm still in school, more information about the units would be "unveiled". So when a unit is considered finished, I finished adding all the information there is available. Updates will still be added.
