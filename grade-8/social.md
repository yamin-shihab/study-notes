# Social Studies 8

Seems to be more thinking than memorizing compared to grade 7 social studies. Note from the future: this was very false. And also as a quick precursor:
+ Worldview is how you view the world, and it's pervasive.
    + Different groups of people share different or similar world views.
+ A worldview isn't a point of view, as a point of view is the way an individual sees things.
+ A worldview isn't a perspective, as a perspective is the way a group sees things.
+ Worldviews are both of these and more. They ask the following questions:
    + How do geographical factors such as climate and location affect people?
    + In what terms does a society view time?
    + What roles are available to individuals in a society? Who holds power, and how is it maintained? Are certain benefits available to some people but not others?
    + How do people in a society act toward each other and to other societies?
    + What beliefs do people hold about life, death, and their environment?
    + Who controls resources? What should be produced? How will it be produced? Who gets it? How is it distributed and protected?
    + How do people develop knowledge? What ways of knowing are accepted? Who has access to knowledge? How is it valued? Where does it reside?

## Chapter 1

+ During the Middle Ages, much of European society was organized in a system called feudalism: a hierarchy in which different people ranked differently from each other based off of their importance.
    + People were born into their level, and were expected to stay at that level.
    + Nobles and knights swore oaths of allegiance (loyalty) to the king. In return, they got land.
    + Barons, bishops, and other members of the Church held lots of power and land, as religion was a very important part of people's lives.
    + Most people were peasants who lived in rural villages on a manor. They were assigned strips of land to plant and harvest.
    + They turned in a portion of what they produced in to the noble that owns the land. Peasants were also illiterate and uneducated.
    + Freemen were peasants who rented land from their lord or worked for pay. The rest were serfs who weren't allowed to leave their manor without permission, and rarely went far.
+ Most medieval towns were centers for farm communities. They usually grew close to castles, palaces, or large monasteries.
    + They were crowded, dirty, and rat-infested places, but offered freedom and opportunities to people. (do what one wanted to do, marry whoever, make money in whatever way)
    + According to the law, runaway serfs could gain freedom by staying in a town for a year and a day without being discovered.
    + Peasants might open workshops, learn trades, or work for wealthy merchants.
    + Production of goods and trade in the towns was organized by organizations called guilds. They controlled prices, set standards, and decided who would be admitted to the craft.
    + After years of working and training, people would take a test to become journeymen and be admitted to the guild. They might even be masters later on and open businesses.
+ The Peasants' Revolts were a series of revolts that broke out from peasants who had to pay high taxes and rents during the Hundred Years' War.
    + Peasants banded together to kill nobles and burn their manors, but they were put down by the authorities.
+ The Black Death resulted in the death of millions of Europeans between 1346 and 1350. Regular outbreaks of the plague continued for the next several hundred years.
    + There were also many manor labor shortages and feudal estates going bankrupt. Nobles eventually had to start renting or selling their land to serfs.
+ As time went on, more people began to keep track of time with clocks and bells instead of the Sun, dials, water clocks, and hourglasses.
+ With the rise of towns, society became less rigid. By acquiring wealth and skills (mostly in cities and towns), urban people could move up from one social level to another.
    + The power and social position of wealthy merchants and the new middle class was based on money rather than land.
    + People became more focused on showing off their wealth through their clothing, homes, and food.
        + This led to the introduction of sumptuary laws: laws that controlled how people could show off their wealth.
+ Religion was a very central part of people's lives daily lives. Life was also very difficult, so a hope for a better life after death was important to people.
    + The Church at the time was very important and had different roles within it. People also had to pay a tithe: a tax toward the Church.
    + Some people decided to devote their lives to God and become monks; they entered monasteries and spent their time studying religious texts, praying, and working. They also helped other people through food donations for the poor, caring for the sick, and teaching children.
        + Monasteries were centers of learning during the Middle Ages, and universities that grew around them taught grammar, geometry, astronomy, religion, law, medicine, and music.
    + The Black Death made some people question their faith; their attempts at pleasing God haven't worked and felt abandoned.
        + People also started to take a critical attitude toward the Church because of this. It was a wealthy institution that owned a third of Europe's land, received large sums of money in tithes, and some members like the clergy got caught up in the enjoyment of luxury.
+ With all these reformations going on, a period of great creativity in the arts and sciences called the Renaissance was about to begin, starting in Italy.
    + Its name is French and means a rebirth of Classical knowledge and learning.

## Chapter 2

+ Marco Polo and his family were known for travelling along the Silk Road. Marco also told stories of his journeys.
+ The Silk Road was the major series of trading routes that connected civilizations from the Mediterranean in the West to the Pacific Ocean in the East. It was helpful for the trade of items, foods, and goods.
    + It was also important because it allowed for the sharing of ideas, knowledge, stories, and experiences. The Renaissance was hugely impacted by it.
+ The crusades were a series of holy wars fought between Christian and Muslim forces aiming to gain control of sacred religious sites in Palestine important in the three Abrahamic religions.
    + They were mainly initiated by the Church in response to Turks taking over the land.
    + The Muslims regained control of Jerusalem after it was captured with the help of the Sultan Saladin.
    + Since the Muslim world was more advanced than Europe, an unintended consequence of the wars was the introduction of new ideas such as medicine, astronomy, philosophy, mathematics, and ancient literature to Europeans.
    + Muslim scholars also accepted the contributions of Christian and Jewish scholars.
    + There was also increased trade, and Europeans were introduced to new goods.
+ During the Renaissance, Italy was a collection of city-states. A city-state consists of a city that's politically independent, and the rural area around it is called the hinterland.
+ Different features contributed greatly to the economic success of Italy:
    + Of all of Europe, Italy was the closest to the port cities of northern Africa and the eastern Mediterranean Sea (they had spices and luxury goods), so trade was made easier.
    + The climate of Italy was milder than the climate in the European countries north of the Alps. This meant that travel was not interrupted, and crops like olives and grapes could be grown.
    + While other countries where monarchies (ruled by a king or queen), Italy was a republic and had independent city-states.
    + Feudalism wasn't as prominent in Italy compared to the other countries at the time in Europe.
+ Because all the city-states wanted to expand, there was rivalry. For example, Genoa and Venice competed for control of the sea routes in the Mediterranean.
    + Venice became the largest ship-building center in Europe.
+ The Polo family was also a group of merchants that made money by purchasing goods and selling them for a higher price somewhere else.
+ There was a revolt in Florence caused by the unemployment caused by the Black Death. Workers like the Ciompi wanted to form guilds, but couldn't because of powerful guilds and the government denying their requests. It caused an uprising that was then defeated.
+ Florence's economy became so powerful that its currency became the most important currency in Europe during the Renaissance, thanks to its banks and bankers.
    + Usury, the practice of charging interest when loaning money to someone, was considered a sin by the Church. However, with the growth of international trade, the Church began to allow charging interest for loans that involved risk.
+ Wealthy Europeans travelled around on business, and helped with spreading Italian values and ideas across Europe.
+ The Medici family was the most famous and powerful family in Italy, and were an important part of Florence's cultural and political life for more than 300 years.
    + They made a fortune as wool and silk merchants and bankers. They also built alliances with other wealthy families.
    + Power was gained by getting acquiring important positions in the Church and getting married into Europe's royal families.
    + By 1434, Cosimo de Medici was powerful enough to take control of Florence, so he bought people's support and exiled his enemies from the city.
    + He then attacked and allied with neighboring city-states
    + Despite being ruthless in political matters, he and the Medici family helped promising artists.
    + Cosimo's grandson, Lorenzo the Magnificent, was a patron of art and literature. He sponsored Michelangelo, Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, and other famous artists and thinkers.

## Chapter 3

+ A new way of thinking starting in the northern Italian city-states known as humanism. It involved scholars looking back to the ancient Classical civilizations of Greece and Rome.
    + They were heavily interested in the ways ancient writers like Aristotle and Plato gave their opinions on society, politics, history, and the arts.
    + The Islamic civilization preserved lots of the Classical civilization and further developed it. (sciences, math, medicine)
    + Humanism was sort of a fad among the wealthy people in society at the time.
+ The Classical concept that was most important to Renaissance thinkers and artists was the belief in the dignity and potential of the individual. They believed that people could shape their lives through their own efforts and talents.
    + Human beings can use the power of reason (thinking) to find truth for themselves.
    + It's important for a person to have an open, curious, and questioning mind.
    + People can achieve great things through learning.
    + Individuals should be skilled in many different areas. They should develop not just their minds but also their bodies and spirits.
    + These new ideas didn't actually contradict or conflict with the Christian worldview: To develop one's talents was to serve God, because God had provided you with those talents.
+ Some humanist scholars, such as Francesco Petrarch, saw the medieval world as a "dark age", and the classical past as a glorious time.
+ Civic humanists were interested in what Classical authors have written about good government. They believed that being a responsible citizen meant educating yourself about history and political issues and working to improve society.
+ One of the most important ways that the humanists influenced Renaissance society was in the emphasis they put on education. Many humanists were dedicated teachers who ran their own schools.
    + They believed that it was important to train young people's characters and bodies as well as their minds. This approach to education is sometimes called "educating the whole child".
    + They encouraged a curious, questioning attitude in their students. Many rulers hired humanists as tutors for their children.
+ Artists became interested in portraying the beauty of the human body and the natural world. Patrons (people who paid artists to produce works) played an important role in promoting the arts during the Renaissance.
    + Many artists found inspiration in the art of the ancient Greeks and Romans. During the Middle Ages, most art had religious themes and this continued through the Renaissance.
    + The Renaissance also saw a growing interest in portraits and landscapes. They also reflected the humanist interest in the individual, the present world, beauty, and human excellence.
    + Art included elements such as the following, previously not present in medieval art:
        + The natural world was much more present.
        + There were accurate lights and shadows.
        + Textures and patterns were more important.
        + Realistic and elegant details evolved.
+ Renaissance architects included features of Classical buildings (pillars/columns, domes, arches) in their work, and raised the status of their profession form skilled laborer to artist.
    + They also used a variety of geometric shapes to develop complex designs, symmetry, and vividly painted interiors and ceilings.
+ Sculptors during the Renaissance became very famous and became like artists, signing their work.
    + This is contrary to sculptors during the Middle Ages, as they were more often seen as craftspeople rather than artists. They worked on cathedrals, carving figures and other biblical decorations.
+ Writers focused on translating the works of Roman and Greek writers as well as copying their styles. More books began to be written in the vernacular (commonly spoken language), to be more accessible.
    + Humanism influenced texts to express thoughts and emotions more.
+ Many humanists also believed that men and women shouldn't be judged by their gender, but their abilities and virtues.

## Chapter 4

+ Before the Renaissance, Europeans that wanted to learn science would have to read books by scholars from Classical or Islamic civilizations and were not encouraged to ask questions, study, or do any experimenting. This is in contrast to the attitudes toward science during the Renaissance, where thinkers did much more using what was called the scientific method.
    + The scientific method was the process of making observations, experimenting, and drawing conclusions based off of evidence. It led to many important discoveries and advances in different fields.
+ For a long time, many people believed that the Sun went around the Earth. It wasn't until different astronomers gave theories as they observed the universe:
    + Nicolaus Copernicus was a Polish astronomer that got ideas from ancient Greek astronomers and discovered that the Earth is a planet that moves around a stationary Sun.
    + Johannes Kepler was a German mathematician and astronomer that used mathematics to prove his ideas based off of Ptolemy and Copernicus's systems that plants travelled in an elliptical (oval) orbit, and not perfect circles.
    + Galileo Galilei was an Italian astronomer and philosopher that built telescopes to study details in objects in the sky and confirm other Copernicus's idea of a Sun-centered universe.
        + The Church charged him with heresy and ordered him to give up his views. If he refused, he might be tortured or burned alive for it, so he read a statement denying his belief in a sun-centered universe and was sentenced to house arrest. His book was put into the Index of Prohibited Books.
+ Before the Renaissance, doctors had little accurate knowledge about anatomy, so remedies were based mostly off of superstition. But then, scientists were able to dissect human bodies and learn more about anatomy to better diagnose and treat problems.
+ The works of mathematical scientists like Euclid and al-Khwarizmi were studied with new vigor during the Renaissance. The field of mathematics was seen as the basis for understanding the universe. Earlier civilizations also contributed to Europe learning.
    + Perspective (what makes images look 3D) had been known in the ancient world, but no record of it had ever been found. The Renaissance architect Filippo Brunelleschi rediscovered the mathematical theory of perspective to show how buildings would look when finished.
+ Isabella D'Este grew up immersed in Renaissance teachings and ruled the city-state of Mantua occasionally.
+ The Florentine civil servant Niccolo Machiavelli observed people and governments and wrote his conclusions on the best way to govern in his book The Prince, and it became very controversial and influential.
    + The term, Machiavellian, is used today to refer to people that seek to hold power by any means possible.
+ During the Middle Ages, some Church members abused their power, gained power unfairly, and did not honor their vows. As time went on, people's complaints grew louder.
    + Girolamo Savonarola was a monk that fought against corrupt leaders, mostly from the Church. He preached before as many thousands of people at times, but was then excommunicated (exclusion from the Church) and later executed.
    + The German monk Martin Luther studied the Bible itself and came to the conclusion that the Bible, rather than the Church, should be a Christian's true spiritual guide. He also criticized the Church for making money by selling indulgences, which were certificates that reduced the time people would be punished for their sins after death.
        + He then nailed his Ninety-Five Theses on a church door in Wittenberg and told other scholars to debate the Church's issues. The theses were then printed and distributed throughout Germany. He was declared an outlaw by the Church, but then a new Church was started: the Lutheran Church. His ideas spreading throughout was known as the Protestant Reformation.
+ The spread of knowledge during the Renaissance was done in different ways:
    + Many humanists taught at Italian universities to share their new ideas through discussions with one another and through their writings. Some people came from all over Europe to learn and bring back knowledge.
    + Some famous scientists, artists, and thinkers were like celebrities travelling around Europe teaching and working with people.
    + Kings and queens invited scholars and writers to their courts and collected manuscripts, paintings, and sculptures.
+ At the time, only the most educated people in society were literate, and books weren't written in the vernacular. This changed when the German named Johannes Gutenberg developed a printing press that allowed books to be quickly be produced cheaply.
    + Soon enough, there were millions of books in print around Europe, and that facilitated the process of sharing knowledge. The ideas of scholars and humanists could be spread more easily and were more accessible due to being written in the vernacular.
