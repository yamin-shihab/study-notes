# Math 8

I had a summative test on the second week of school!

# ***!!! ADDITIONAL NOTICE !!!***

### For some reason, we learned almost exactly the same things this year and last year for Math, so use the grade 7 study guide for Math along with the extra things in this grade 8 Math study guide.

## Ratios and Rates

+ A ratio is a colon-separated group of terms (quantities/numbers) of the same unit that can be of two types:
    + A part to part ratio compares each part of a group to the other parts of the same group. (three red marbles and four blue marbles in a bag is 3:4 or 4:3)
    + A part to whole ratio compares a part or two to the whole group. (three red marbles and four blue marbles in a bag is 4:7 or 3:7)
+ Ratios can have two or three terms. (9:8, 1:2:3)
+ A unit ratio is a ratio where one of the terms is the value of one. (3:1, 6:1)
+ Equivalent ratios are essentially equivalent fractions that can be easily written as another form. (1:2 = 2:4, 5:3:11 = 15:9:33)
    + The lowest terms of a ratio is the smallest possible equivalent ratio of it.
+ A rate compares two quantities measured in different units. (200 meters/2.3 minutes)
+ A unit rate is a rate in which the second term is one. ($3.50/1 pounds = $7.00/2 pounds)
    + You can use unit rates to find out the better deal when buying things. (store A offers four bananas for $5.00 and store B offers five bananas for $6.00 -> $5.00 / 4 bananas = $1.25/1 banana, $6.00 / 5 bananas = $1.20/1 banana -> B is cheaper than A)
    + The uses of a unit rate isn't limited to buying things. (Jesse can type 187 words in 5 minutes, and Brent can type 444 words in 10 minutes -> 187 words * 2 = 374 words/10 minutes -> 444 words/10 minutes > 374 words/10 minutes)
    + The use of unit rates is similar to using fractions and division.

## Integers

+ If both numbers are of the same sign in multiplication or division, the answer is positive, otherwise it's negative. (3 * 3 = 9, 4 * -2 = -8, -5 / -1 = 5, -8 / 8 = -1)
+ Multiplying a positive or negative number by a negative number can be done using number tiles:
    1. Represent the first number using either positive or negative tiles.
    2. Copy that group of tiles by the number of times specified by the second number.
+ To multiply a positive or negative number by a negative number with number tiles, you will essentially be "removing" the number from zero:
    1. Represent the multiplication of the two in zero pairs.
    2. Remove groups of either the positive or negative tiles such that the end result will be of the correct sign.
+ A positive or negative number can be divided by a positive number using number tiles by splitting things up into groups:
    1. Represent the first number using the appropriate number tiles.
    2. For each group of tiles representing the second number, circle it.
    3. The answer will be the number of groups.

## Fractions

+ To multiply or divide two fractions, they must both be an improper fraction.
+ You can multiply two improper fractions in the lowest terms:
    1. Reduce the numerator of the first fraction and the denominator of the second as if it was an equivalent fraction. (2 and 4 -> 1 and 2)
    2. Do the same for the numerator of the second fraction and the denominator of the first.
    3. The answer's numerator is the first numerator multiplied by the second numerator.
    4. The answer's denominator is the first denominator multiplied by the second denominator.
+ The process of dividing two fractions is the same as multiplying but with an extra step:
    1. Make the second fraction its reciprocal (reverse/flip/inverse) of the second fraction. (1/2 -> 2/1)
    2. Multiply the resulting two fractions together.
+ You can also multiply fractions by filling in a grid and divide fractions by grouping parts of a grid.
