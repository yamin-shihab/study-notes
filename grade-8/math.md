# Math 8

I had a summative test on the second week of school!

# ***!!! ADDITIONAL NOTICE !!!***

### For some reason, we learned almost exactly the same things this year and last year for Math, so use the grade 7 study guide for Math along with the extra things in this grade 8 Math study guide.

## Ratios and Rates

+ A ratio is a colon-separated group of terms (quantities/numbers) of the same unit that can be of two types:
    + A part to part ratio compares each part of a group to the other parts of the same group. (three red marbles and four blue marbles in a bag is 3:4 or 4:3)
    + A part to whole ratio compares a part or two to the whole group. (three red marbles and four blue marbles in a bag is 4:7 or 3:7)
+ Ratios can have two or three terms. (9:8, 1:2:3)
+ A unit ratio is a ratio where one of the terms is the value of one. (3:1, 6:1)
+ Equivalent ratios are essentially equivalent fractions that can be easily written as another form. (1:2 = 2:4, 5:3:11 = 15:9:33)
    + The lowest terms of a ratio is the smallest possible equivalent ratio of it.
+ A rate compares two quantities measured in different units. (200 meters/2.3 minutes)
+ A unit rate is a rate in which the second term is one. ($3.50/1 pounds = $7.00/2 pounds)
    + You can use unit rates to find out the better deal when buying things. (store A offers four bananas for $5.00 and store B offers five bananas for $6.00 -> $5.00 / 4 bananas = $1.25/1 banana, $6.00 / 5 bananas = $1.20/1 banana -> B is cheaper than A)
    + The uses of a unit rate isn't limited to buying things. (Jesse can type 187 words in 5 minutes, and Brent can type 444 words in 10 minutes -> 187 words * 2 = 374 words/10 minutes -> 444 words/10 minutes > 374 words/10 minutes)
    + The use of unit rates is similar to using fractions and division.
